## Abstract

The `grpc++_public_hdrs` target is not indended for public use, and it is being made private. It is redundant to the `grpc++` target, and all users should depend on `grpc++` instead.

## Background

The gRPC Core/C++ public API headers are exposed from multiple bazel targets, and users should only need to depend on the complete grpc and grpc++ targets.
The `*_public_hdrs` targets are sometimes useful for internal gRPC build configurations, and are still used to break up large monolithic targets and avoid circular dependencies.
Nobody knows whether these redundant header-only targets were ever meant to be public when they were introduced many years ago, but it's generally thought to be a bad idea.
Today, there is no good reason to continue to expose redundant header-only gRPC public API targets, and their existence is a liability and a nuisance.

In the past few years, the gRPC maintainers have put effort into reclaiming ownership of internal code, which has improved our ability to make changes that should not affect our users.
The long-term plan is to refactor the build configuration and ideally delete the public header targets entirely.

## Proposal

The `grpc++_public_hdrs` target will be given private visibility.
