## Abstract

The protocol buffers compiler (`protoc`) and the gRPC C# compiler plugin 
(`grpc_csharp_plugin`) generate C# code that does not use the
[nullable reference types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references)
language features introduced in C# 8.0.

This document discusses the changes to be made to the code generation, the support 
in `Grpc.Tools`, and any impact on existing projects.

## Background

_Nullable reference types_ refers to a group of optional features introduced in 
C# 8.0 to enable the compiler to do static flow analysis to determine if a variable 
might be null before it is dereferenced. They are compile time features that do not affect the runtime.

Various issues have been raised asking for the code generated by the protocol
buffers compiler (`protoc`), the gRPC C# compiler plugin (`grpc_csharp_plugin`),
and `Grpc.Tools` to support nullable reference types, including:

- [Investigate support for nullable reference types in generated code](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet/issues/606)
- [Add option to generate C# nullable annotations](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/6632)
- [Support C# 8 nullable type references in Grpc.Tools](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/20729)

Currently the code that is generated is compatible with C# 7.3 and is not in a 
*nullable context* since the `// <auto-generated>` comment in the code disables it.

No nullable checks are made and no compiler warnings are generated for this code,
even when the code is compiled in a project with nullable checks enabled.
This means that some nullable checks that could be useful in user code are not done.

**Note:** here we are *not* proposing any changes to the API or semantics to support
protobuf optional fields as nullable, as sometimes requested (e.g. - 
[C#: Consider exposing protobuf optional fields as nullable properties](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9083)).
That has already been addressed in the above issue.

## Proposal

The proposal is to add optional support for generating code that is aware of the
nullable reference types support in C#. Existing projects that do not want to
use this feature (for example, those using C# 7.3) will continue to work with
the code generated without nullable support. Projects using C# 8.0 can take advantage
of the nullable support if they so wish.

### Code generation

Options will be added to `protoc` and `grpc_csharp_plugin` to enable generating of code
that supports nullable reference types. By default (without the new option) the code
generated will be the same as today.

Proposed name of option: `enable_nrt`

e.g. 

```bash
protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=grpc_csharp_plugin \
    --csharp_out=. \
    --csharp_opt=enable_nrt \
    --grpc_opt=enable_nrt \
    myproto.proto
```

The details of the changes to the generated code are described below.

### MSBuild integration

`Grpc.Tools` will be changed to detect if a project has nullable enabled and
automatically add the options to `protoc` and `grpc_csharp_plugin` if needed.

A mechanism will be added to override this default behaviour. This will allow
users to explicitly choose whether the code generated has nullable support or not.
For example, it may be that the user wants to generate code that is compatible
with other projects using an older compiler. This override will be done by setting
the MSBuild property `gRPC_NullableReferenceTypes` to either `enable` or `disable`.

## Rationale

The _Nullable reference types_ feature was introduced in C# 8.0 in 2019. Supporting
this language feature will give gRPC users information about null references in their
code. For example:

User's protocol buffers file:
```proto
message User {
  string name = 1;
  Address address = 2;
}

message Address {
  string street = 1;
  string city = 2;
}
```

User's C# code:
```c#
public override Task<Empty> AddUser(User user, ServerCallContext context)
{
    AddressEntity entity = new
    {
        Street = user.Address.Street, // Possible null reference exception
        City = user.Address.City,
    };
    _addressRepository.Add(entity);

    // rest of the method
}
```

Right now this will happily compile without warnings. If the generated code had 
added the annotations for nullable reference types then the user would get a warning
and would know that `User.Address` could be null.

## Implementation

There are three projects that need to be changed to fully support nullable reference types:
- Protocol buffers C# code generation (Protocol buffers team)
  - https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/main/src/google/protobuf/compiler/csharp
- gRPC C# plugin (gRPC team)
  - https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/compiler
- Grpc.Tools (gRPC team)
  - https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/csharp/Grpc.Tools 

It will require collaboration between the Protocol Buffers team and the gRPC team to
coordinate the release of this feature.

Below lists the known changes that will be needed. Other changes needed may become apparent during development.

### Protocol buffers code generation

Add the `enable_nrt` option, and when enabled changes will include:
- add `#nullable` directive
- add annotations to Message fields as they can be null
- `Equals(obj)` and `Equals(T)` would have nullable parameters
- `MergeFrom(T)` would have a nullable parameter

### gRPC plugin code generation

Add the `enable_nrt` option, and when enabled changes will include:
- add `#nullable` directive
- `BindService` would have a nullable parameter
- add annotations to the `headers` parameter on gRPC client methods

### Grpc.Tools changes
In Grpc.Tools the following needs to be done:
- Conditionally set property `gRPC_NullableReferenceTypes` if not already set by
  checking the value of the `Nullable` property
- Add option to `_GrpcOutputOptions` and `_OutputOptions` depending on the value
  of `gRPC_NullableReferenceTypes`

### Existing PRs
There are already implementations of the above with varying degrees of completeness:
- protobuf PR 13218 [Add option to enable csharp nullable reference types](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/13218)
- gprc/grpc PR 33878 [Add null reference types support to gRPC C# plugin](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33878)
- grpc/grpc PR 33879 [Grpc.Tools changes to support nullable reference types](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33879)

## Related work
There is separate and ongoing work to implement nullable annotations in the
[Google.Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/main/csharp/src/Google.Protobuf)
runtime. This is not part of this proposal which is focused on the code generation.
