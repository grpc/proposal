* Status: Ready for Implementation

## Abstract

gRPC is currently implementing an open-source standard authorization solution.
This proposal discusses how this framework would be made available to OSS gRPC
users (like network switches) to perform per-RPC authorization checks.

## Background

Authentication verifies the identity of the requestor. Authorization ensures that
the requestor has sufficient access to make a particular request.

gRPC offers built-in authentication mechanisms like TLS, ALTS and even allows
users to plug in their own authentication systems. However, gRPC doesn't have any
standard authorization solution available. If a user wanted to perform per RPC
authorization checks, they have to implement their own solution in the application.
The standard gRPC authorization mechanism described in this proposal allows users
to simply provide an authorization policy for their server. Then, for each RPC,
the server verifies whether the client is authorized to make the RPC request.

## Proposal

### User facing Authorization Policy

gRPC authorization policy is the user facing policy language that allows
service owners and/or security admins to enable per-RPC authorization checks.

This authorization policy is extendable, we may add new fields in the future as
new requirements are introduced, we wonâ€™t be removing fields or updating
semantics of existing fields. However, this means if user wants to use policy
with new fields, they need to use the right gRPC version. Using policy with new
fields, with an older version of gRPC, will result in policy being marked invalid.
This is essential, because otherwise we may end up allowing an RPC request without
even evaluating the new field values in policy, which poses a security risk.

Following is the JSON schema of gRPC Authorization Policy Version 1.0

#### Details

gRPC authorization policy has a list of *allow rules* and a list of *deny rules*.
The following sequence is followed to make an authorization decision -
1. Check for a match in *deny rules*, if a match is found, the request will be denied.
   If no match is found in deny rules, or there are no deny rules execute next step.
2. Check for a match in *allow rules*, if a match is found, the request will be allowed.
   Note that allow rules is a required field here, if not present, policy is invalid.
3. If no match is found in *allow rules*, we deny the request.

Each *rule* has the following semantics -
1. Each *rule* has a *name*, a *source* and a *request* to match against. For a *rule*
   to match, both *source* and *request* must match.
   - If both *source* and *request* are empty, the *rule* always matches. It is a
     wildcard that can be used in a deny list to deny all RPCs or in an allow list to
     accept all RPCs except those matching in the deny list.
   - If only *source* is empty, we evaluate against the *request* fields and apply
     that to any user (See example below). Similarly, if only *request* is empty, we
     evaluate against the *source* fields and apply that to any action.
2. Each *source* could contain a list of *principals*. The *principals* are ORed
   together, i.e. it matches if one of them matches.
   Sequence of steps to evaluate each principal from config -
   1. If TLS is not used, matching fails.
   2. If there is no client certificate, we get a match if principal is an empty
      string.
   3. If we have a client certificate, we check against certificate contents. A
      match is found if principal matches URI SANs from the certificate. If
      there are no URI SANs in certificate, or no match was found, we check
      against DNS SANs. Similarly, if certificate has no DNS SANs or match wasn't
      found, we check against Subject field from certificate.
3. Each *request* could contain a list of URL *paths* (i.e. fully qualified RPC
   methods) and list of http *headers* to match. Refer JSON schema above to
   understand matching semantics.
   - If the sub-fields are empty, like if the *paths* is empty (assuming *headers*
     is unset), the behavior would be similar to an empty *request* since no other
     *request* fields are set.

#### Example

In the following policy example
- Peer identity from ["spiffe://foo.com/sa/admin1", "spiffe://foo.com/sa/admin2"] is 
  authorized to access any RPC methods in pkg.service
- Any authenticated user is allowed to access "foo" and "bar" RPC methods if the
  HTTP header includes a name "dev-path" with prefix value "dev/path/".
- Nobody can access "secret" RPC method, not even the admins as deny rules are evaluated 
  first.

```json
{
	"name": "example-policy",
	"allow_rules": [
		{
			"name": "admin-access",
			"source": {
				"principals": [
					"spiffe://foo.com/sa/admin1",
					"spiffe://foo.com/sa/admin2"
				]
			},
			"request": {
				"paths": ["/pkg.service/*"]
			}
		},
		{
			"name": "dev-access",
			"source": {
				"principals": ["*", ""]
			},
			"request": {
				"paths": [
					"/pkg.service/foo",
					"/pkg.service/bar"
				],
				"headers": [
					{
						"key": "dev-path",
						"values": ["/dev/path/*"]
					}
				]
			}
		}
	],
	"deny_rules": [
		{
			"name": "deny-access",
			"request": {
				"paths": [
					"*/secret"
				]
			}
		}
	]
}
```

### API

gRPC will support both static initialization and dynamically reloading the policy
from filesystem. In static initialization, the policy will be provided as a JSON
string. In dynamic file reloading, the application will specify the file path that
contains the authorization policy in JSON format.

Valid user provided authorization policy creates authorization engine(s). In the
case of file watcher, we internally create thread(C-core)/ goroutine(Go)/
scheduled service(Java) which will be used to read the policy file periodically,
and update the authorization engines. During the first file read, if the policy
is invalid or there are I/O errrors, we will return error back to the application,
which will generally result in the gRPC server not starting. If the error occurs
on a later reload, then that particular reload will be skipped and error will be
logged, and we will continue to use the latest valid policy to make authorization
decisions.

For each incoming RPC request, we will invoke the Engines (Deny engine followed
by Allow engine), to get the authorization decision. We use a C-core filter for
C++, and interceptors for Java and Go.

We recommend users to use a single gRPC authorization policy per gRPC server. If
there are multiple policies, then there is a possibility that all the policies
may not be evaluated against. For ex. if we have two policies for two different
services say service A and service B. RPC to service B may get rejected, without
even evaluating against service B policy, because it is evaluated after service A
policy. On getting no match, service A policy could deny by default.

Following code snippets show how to enable authorization in gRPC servers in
different languages.

#### C++

##### C++ Authorization Provider API

```C++
// Wrapper around C-core grpc_authorization_policy_provider. Internally, it
// handles creating and updating authorization engine objects, using gRPC
// authorization policy.
class AuthorizationPolicyProviderInterface {
 public:
  virtual ~AuthorizationPolicyProviderInterface() = default;
  virtual grpc_authorization_policy_provider* c_provider() = 0;
};

// Implementation obtains authorization policy from static string. This provider
// will always return the same authorization engines.
class StaticDataAuthorizationPolicyProvider
      : public AuthorizationPolicyProviderInterface {
 public:
  static std::unique_ptr<StaticDataAuthorizationPolicyProvider>
     Create(const std::string& authz_policy, grpc::Status* status);

  ~StaticDataAuthorizationPolicyProvider override();
 private:
  grpc_authorization_policy_provider* provider_;
};

// Implementation obtains authorization policy by watching for changes in
// filesystem. This provider will return up-to-date authorization engines.
class FileWatcherAuthorizationPolicyProvider final
    : public AuthorizationPolicyProviderInterface {
 public:
  static std::unique_ptr<FileWatcherAuthorizationPolicyProvider>
    Create(const std::string& authz_policy_path,
           unsigned int refresh_interval_sec,
           grpc::Status* status);

  ~FileWatcherAuthorizationPolicyProvider override();

// StaticInterceptor contains engines used to make authorization decisions.
type StaticInterceptor struct {
  // ...
}

// NewStatic returns a new StaticInterceptor from a static authorization policy
// JSON string.
func NewStatic(authzPolicy string) (*StaticInterceptor, error) {
  // ...
}

// UnaryInterceptor intercepts incoming Unary RPC requests.
// Only authorized requests are allowed to pass. Otherwise, an unauthorized
// error is returned to the client.
func (i *StaticInterceptor) UnaryInterceptor(

		(resp interface{}, err error) {
  // ...
}

// StreamInterceptor intercepts incoming Stream RPC requests.

// error is returned to the client.
func (i *StaticInterceptor) StreamInterceptor(
	srv interface{}, ss grpc.ServerStream, info *grpc.StreamServerInfo, handler grpc.StreamHandler)
		(err error) {
  // ...
}

type FileWatcherInterceptor struct {
  // ...

// NewFileWatcher returns a new FileWatcherInterceptor from a policy file
// that contains JSON string of authorization policy and a refresh duration to
// specify the amount of time between policy refreshes.

## Rationale

gRPC Authorization internally implements RBAC Engine(s) based on Envoy [RBAC policy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/api/envoy/config/rbac/v3/rbac.proto).
We decided to create a new policy language "gRPC authorization policy" instead of
consuming Envoy RBAC directly due to following reasons:
- Envoy RBAC is a complex language, and we preferred using a simple human readable 
  policy language
- With our own language, we can provide a stable API, even when Envoy undergoes 
  versioning updates.

Note that gRPC authorization policy is a subset of Envoy RBAC, and it does not
support all the fields that are present in Envoy RBAC. 

RBAC policy provides service-level and method-level access control for a service.
Engines process incoming RPC request attributes against policy configs and make a
decision on whether to allow or deny the request. The decision depends on the type
of policy (if the policy is an allowlist or denylist) and whether a matching policy
was found.

This engine implementation is also used by xDS-based authorization. In xDS
authorization, the xDS server sends an RBAC policy config to xDS-enabled gRPC server
for authorization.([A41](A41-xds-rbac.md): xDS RBAC Support)

Overall gRPC authorization flow is as follows. User supplies gRPC authorization
policy to provider/interceptor. The provider then forwards the JSON policy to Policy
translator. The translator converts JSON policy to Envoy RBAC protos (Allow and/or
Deny policy). Translator errors out on I/O errors or if the policy does not
represent JSON schema it currently supports. Ultimately the generated RBAC policies
are used to create Envoy RBAC authorization engine(s). Then, for each incoming RPC
request, we will invoke the Engines to get the authorization decision.

gRPC authorization can be enabled in xDS enabled servers, which means both
authorization paths (gRPC and xDS authorization) can co-exist. For a request to
be allowed, both paths must allow the request.

As mentioned previously, authorization APIs take policy in JSON format, instead of
protobuf. This is done to avoid the dependency on protobuf. We have users in OSS
that use gRPC without protobuf. Another reason is to have a consistent API across
languages.

## Implementation

The implementation order will be C++, Go, Java and then wrapped languages. The 
implementation will be done by ashithasantosh.
