## Abstract

Add conversion operations between absl::Status and grpc::Status to help boost interoperability with that library, and to aid in modernizing our codebase.

## Background

grpc::Status was originally intended to be a polyfill for absl::Status.
The released absl::Status however was not directly compatible with grpc::Status.
Introduce canonical conversion operations between the two types.

## Proposal

Add to grpc::Status:
- an explicit conversion from absl::Status
- implicit const& and && conversion operators to absl::Status

i.e.:

```
namespace grpc {
class Status {
 public:
  // ...
  explicit Status(absl::Status&&);
  operator const absl::Status&() const;
};
}
```

## Rationale

We'd like to change to absl::Status everywhere, but we can't.
Internal users are experiencing pain since these conversions are available there, but not externally.

## Implementation

This proposal will be implemented as a single PR (and likely an associated cherry-pick internally).

## Open issues (if applicable)
