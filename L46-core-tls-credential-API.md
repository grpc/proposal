L46: C-core: New TLS Credentials API
----
* Author(s): gtcooke94, ZhenLian

* Status: Draft
* Implemented in:
* Last updated: May 16, 2024

## Abstract

This proposal aims to provide a new TLS credentials API with the following features:
1. Credential reloading: reload transport credentials periodically from various sources, e.g. from credential files, or users' customized Provider implementations, without shutting down.
1. Customizable verification of the peer certificate: perform custom validation checks on the peer's certificate chain after it has been verified to chain up to a root of trust, or fully customize path building and cryptographic verification.
1. TLS version configuration: optionally configure the minimum and maximum of the TLS versions to be negotiated during the handshake.
1.Â Support for certificate revocation via Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

## Background

The current TLS implementation (the SSL credentials API) in gRPC C core has some restrictions:
1. Lack of the credential reloading support. Once an application starts, it can never reload its private key, certificate chain conveying the application's identity, and root certificates without shutting down.
1. Inflexibility of how the peer certificate chain is verified. There is no API to add additional custom verification checks.
1. Inability to choose the maximum/minimum TLS version to be negotiated during the TLS handshake.
1. No support for certificate revocation.

We propose an API that supports the above features and meets the following requirements:  

1. Flexible enough to support multiple use cases. Users should be able to write their own reloading or verification logic if the provided ones do not fit their needs.
1. The credential reloading should be efficient. We shall reload only when needed rather than reloading per TLS connection.
1. C core API needs to be simple enough, so that most of existing SSL credentials in wrapped languages can migrate to call this new API.

### Related Proposals:

## Proposal

### TLS credentials and TLS Options
This part of the proposal introduces the base options class, called `TlsCredentialsOptions`, that has a large set of options for configuring TLS connections. There are 2 derived classes of `TlsCredentialsOptions`, called `TlsChannelCredentialsOptions` and `TlsServerCredentialsOptions`, that users create and can use to build channel credentials or server credentials instances, respectively. The API for building these channel/server credentials instances are called `TlsCredentials`/`TlsServerCredentials` respectively.

```c++
// Base class of configurable options specified by users to configure their
// certain security features supported in TLS.
class TlsCredentialsOptions {
 public:
  ~TlsCredentialsOptions();

  // Copy constructor does a deep copy. No assignment permitted.
  TlsCredentialsOptions(const TlsCredentialsOptions& other);

  TlsCredentialsOptions& operator=(const TlsCredentialsOptions& other) = delete;

  // ---- Setters for member fields ----
  // Sets the certificate provider used to store root certificates and the
  // certificate chain conveying the application's identity and corresponding
  // private key.
  void set_certificate_provider(
      std::shared_ptr<CertificateProviderInterface> certificate_provider);

  // Watches the updates of root certificates with name |root_cert_name| (set by
  // the user via set_root_cert_name).  If used in TLS credentials, setting this
  // field is optional for both the client side and the server side.
  // If this is not set on the client side, we will use the root certificates
  // stored in the default system location, since client side must provide root
  // certificates in TLS (no matter single-side TLS or mutual TLS).
  // If this is not set on the server side, we will not watch any root
  // certificate updates, and assume no root certificates needed for the server
  // (in the one-side TLS scenario, the server is not required to provide root
  // certificates). We don't support default root certs on server side.
  void watch_root_certificates();

  // Sets the name of root certificates being watched, if |watch_root_certificates| is
  // called. If not set, an empty string will be used as the name. For simple
  // use cases this is not needed, but a certificate provider could be
  // implemented that watches many sets of certificates. This allows the user to
  // differentiate between different root certificates.
  // 
  // @param root_cert_name the name of root certificates being set.
  void set_root_cert_name(const std::string& root_cert_name);

  // Watches the updates of identity key-certificate pairs with name
  // |identity_cert_name|. If used in TLS credentials, it is required to be set
  // on the server side, and optional for the client side(in the one-side
  // TLS scenario, the client is not required to provide identity certificates).
  void watch_identity_key_cert_pairs();

  // Sets the name of identity key-certificate pairs being watched, if
  // |watch_identity_key_cert_pairs| is called. If not set, an empty string will
  // be used as the name.
  //
  // @param identity_cert_name the name of identity key-certificate pairs being set.
  void set_identity_cert_name(const std::string& identity_cert_name);

  // Sets the TLS session key logging file path. If not set, TLS
  // session key logging is disabled. Note that this should be used only for
  // debugging purposes. It should never be used in a production environment
  // due to security concerns.
  //
  // @param tls_session_key_log_file_path: Path where TLS session keys should
  // be logged.
  void set_tls_session_key_log_file_path(
      const std::string& tls_session_key_log_file_path);

  // Sets the certificate verifier. The certificate verifier performs checks on
  // the peer certificate chain after the chain has been (cryptographically)
  // verified to chain up to a trusted root.
  void set_certificate_verifier(
      std::shared_ptr<CertificateVerifier> certificate_verifier);

  // Sets the crl provider, see CrlProvider for more details.
  void set_crl_provider(std::shared_ptr<CrlProvider> crl_provider);

  // Sets the minimum TLS version that will be negotiated during the TLS
  // handshake. If not set, the underlying SSL library will default to TLS v1.2.
  // @param tls_version: The minimum TLS version.
  void set_min_tls_version(grpc_tls_version tls_version);

  // Sets the maximum TLS version that will be negotiated during the TLS
  // handshake. If not set, the underlying SSL library will default to TLS v1.3.
  // @param tls_version: The maximum TLS version.
  void set_max_tls_version(grpc_tls_version tls_version);

  // Sets a custom chain builder implementation that replaces the default chain
  // building from the underlying SSL library. Fully replacing and implementing
  // chain building is a complex task and has dangerous security implications if
  // done wrong, thus this API is inteded for expert use only.
  void set_custom_chain_builder(std::shared_ptr<CustomChainBuilder>
  chain_builder);
}

// Server-specific options for configuring TLS.
class TlsServerCredentialsOptions final : public TlsCredentialsOptions {
 public:
  // A certificate provider that provides identity credentials is required,
  // because a server must always present identity credentials during any TLS
  // handshake. The certificate provider may optionally provide root
  // certificates, in case the server requests client certificates.
  explicit TlsServerCredentialsOptions(
      std::shared_ptr<CertificateProviderInterface> certificate_provider)
      : TlsCredentialsOptions() {
    set_certificate_provider(certificate_provider);
  }


  // Sets requirements for if client certificates are requested, if they
  // are required, and if the client certificate must be trusted.  The
  // default is GRPC_SSL_DONT_REQUEST_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE.
  void set_cert_request_type(
      grpc_ssl_client_certificate_request_type cert_request_type);
}

// Client-specific options for configuring TLS.
//
// A client may optionally set a certificate provider.
// If there is no certificate provider, the system default root certificates will be used to
// verify server certificates. 
// If a certificate provider is set and it provides root certifices that root
// will be used.
// If a certificate provider is set and it provides identity credentials those
// identity credentials will be used.
class TlsChannelCredentialsOptions final : public TlsCredentialsOptions {
 public:
  // Sets the decision of whether to do a crypto check on the server certificates.
  // The default is true.
  void set_verify_server_certificates(bool verify_server_certs);
}

// Builds a ChannelCredentials instance that establishes TLS connections in the manner specified by options.
std::shared_ptr<ChannelCredentials> TlsCredentials(
    const TlsChannelCredentialsOptions& options);
}

// Builds a ServerCredentials instance that establishes TLS connections in the manner specified by options.
std::shared_ptr<ServerCredentials> TlsServerCredentials(
    const TlsServerCredentialsOptions& options);
```

Here is an example of how to configure channel credentials:
```c++
/* Create option and set basic security primitives. */
TlsChannelCredentialsOptions options = TlsChannelCredentialsOptions();
options.set_verify_server_cert(true);
options.set_min_tls_version(TLS1_2);
options.set_max_tls_version(TLS1_3);

/* Create TLS channel credentials. */
std::shared_ptr<ChannelCredentials> creds = TlsCredentials(options);
```

### Credential Reloading
Credential reloading will be implemented via a `CertificateProviderInterface`.
This provider is responsible for sourcing key material and supplying it to the
internal stack via the `CertificateProvider`'s `SetKeyMaterials` API.  Two
reference implementations of the `CertificateProviderInterface` are provided -
`StaticDataCertificateProvider` and `FileWatcherCertificateProvider`. The
`StaticDataCertificateProvider` provides certificates from raw string data. The
`FileWatcherCertificateProvider` will periodically and asynchronously refresh
certificate data from a file, allowing changes to certificates without
restarting the client/server. More detail about these reference implementations
is provided below. These implementations should cover many use cases.  If these
providers do not support the intricacies for a specific use case, a user can
provide their own implementations of the `CertificateProviderInterface`.

```c
/* Opaque types. */
// A struct that stores the credential data presented to the peer in handshake
// to show local identity. The private_key and certificate_chain must be PEM
// encoded and the public key in the leaf certificate must correspond to the
// given private key.
struct IdentityKeyCertPair {
  std::string private_key_pem;
  std::string certificate_chain_pem;
};


/** ------------------------------------ Provider ------------------------------------ */
/** Provides identity credentials and root certificates.
*/
class CertificateProviderInterface {
 public:
  virtual ~CertificateProviderInterface() = default;
  // Provider implementations MUST provide a WatchStatusCallback that will be
  // called by the internal stack. This will be invoked when a new certificate
  // name is starting to be used internally, or when a certificate name is no
  // longer being used internally. When being invoked for a new certificate,
  // this callback should call `SetKeyMaterials` to do the initial population
  // the certificate data in the internal stack.
  // 
  // For the parameters in the callback function:
  // cert_name The name of the certificates being watched.
  // root_being_watched If the root certificates with the specific name are being
  // watched.
  // identity_being-Watched If the identity certificates with the specific name
  // are being watched.
  virtual void WatchStatusCallback(std::string cert_name, bool root_being_watched, bool identity_being_watched) = 0;

  // Sets the key materials based on their certificate name.
  // @param cert_name The name of the certificates being updated.
  // @param pem_root_certificates The content of root certificates.
  // @param pem_key_cert_pairs The content of identity key-certificate pairs.
  void SetKeyMaterials(
      const std::string& cert_name, absl::optional<std::string> pem_root_certificates,
      absl::optional<grpc_core::PemKeyCertPairList> pem_key_cert_pairs);

  // Propagates an error encountered in the provider layer to the internal TLS stack.
  //
  // @param cert_name The watching certificate name that the caller
  // wants to notify about when encountering error.
  // @param root_cert_error The error that the caller encounters when reloading
  // root certificates.
  // @param identity_cert_error The error that the caller encounters when
  // reloading identity certificates.
  void SetErrorForCert(const std::string& cert_name,
                       absl::Status root_cert_error,
                       absl::Status identity_cert_error);

 private:
  std::unique_ptr<TlsCertificateDistributor> distributor_;
};

/** ------------------------------------ Provider ------------------------------------ */
/** Provides identity credentials and root certificates.

// This represents a potential decoupling of roots and identity chains, with
// further extension points for something like SPIFFE bundles
class CertificateProviderInterface {
 public:
  virtual ~CertificateProviderInterface() = default;
  // Provider implementations MUST provide a LoadAndSetCredentialsCallback that
  // will be called by the internal stack. This will be invoked when a new

  // name is no longer being used internally. When being invoked for a new
  // certificate, this callback should call SetRootCertificates or
  // SetIdentityChainAndPrivateKey to do the initial population the certificate
  // data in the internal stack.

// key-certificate pair, so SNI(Server Name Indication) is not supported.
// 2. The private key and identity certificate should always match. This API
// guarantees atomic read, and it is the callers' responsibility to do atomic
// updates. There are many ways to atomically update the key and certificates in the
// file system. To name a few:
//   1)  creating a new directory, renaming the old directory to a new name, and
//   then renaming the new directory to the original name of the old directory.
//   2)  using a symlink for the directory. When need to change, put new
//   credential data in a new directory, and change symlink.

  // certificate chain.

  // @param refresh_interval_sec is the refreshing interval that we will check
  // the files for updates.

### Custom Verification
We aim to provide distinct interfaces for chain building customization and for additional validation of an already built chain. These two features have distinctly different expected users. Doing some extra validation based on the contents of the peer certificate chain is an operation that anyone doing (m)TLS might be interested in, and it should not and does not require any deep X.509 expertise. Replacing how chain building works is a relatively rare requirement and it does require deep X.509 expertise to do correctly. We want extra validation to be easy and clear for users to add without worrying about interacting with chain building itself. On the other hand, chain building is complex to implement, and we suspect that most users will stay with the default behavior. However, to enable advanced use, such as dynamic selection of the trust bundle based on the peer certificate (e.g. SPIFFE federation), this is needed. 
#### Post Handshake Verification

// The base class of all internal verifier implementations, and the ultimate
// class that all external verifiers will eventually be transformed into.
// To implement a custom verifier, do not extend this class; instead,

  //              The status of the verifier as it has already done it's

  // Used when the connection attempt times out or is cancelled while an async
  // verification request is pending.
  //
  // request: the verification information associated with this request
  void Cancel(TlsCustomVerificationCheckRequest* request);
};

// A CertificateVerifier that doesn't perform any additional checks other than
// certificate verification, if specified.
// Note: using this solely without any other authentication mechanisms on the
// peer identity will leave your applications to the MITM(Man-In-The-Middle)
// attacks. Users should avoid doing so in production environments.
class NoOpCertificateVerifier : public CertificateVerifier {
 public:
  NoOpCertificateVerifier();
};

// A CertificateVerifier that will perform hostname verification, to see if the
// target name set from the client side matches the identity information
// specified on the server's certificate.
class HostNameCertificateVerifier : public CertificateVerifier {
 public:
  HostNameCertificateVerifier();
};
```

#### Custom Chain Building
```c++
class CustomChainBuilderInterface {
public:
 // TODO(gtcooke94) - more detail here on output specifics.
 // The output chain should consist of DER encoded certs ordered in the same way
 // that Open/BoringSSL build chains in `X509_verify_cert` including the root of
 // the trusted chain.
 virtual absl::StatusOr<std::vector<absl::string_view>>
 BuildAndVerifyChain(const std::vector<absl::string_view>& peer_cert_chain_der)
 = 0;
 virtual ~CustomChainBuilderInterface() = 0;
}
```

The default behavior for chain building is based on the underlying SSL library. For example, [X509_verify_cert](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/X509_verify_cert.html) is the implementation in OpenSSL that builds and verifies a certificate chain.
gRPC calls that function by default [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/2d2d5a3c411a2bade319a08085e55821cf2d5ed9/src/core/tsi/ssl_transport_security.cc#L1150).
Once the `CustomChainBuilder` is implemented, this will be where it is used. The `X509_verify_cert` call will be replaced by the `CustomChainBuilder's BuildAndVerifyChain` that fully replaces chain building.
Replacing chain building is very complex and can open dangerous security holes if done wrong. Most users should not expect to use this API. However, there exist use cases for such behavior - for example, building chains from SPIFFE IDs and trust maps.
