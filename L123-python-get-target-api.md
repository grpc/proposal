## 1. Abstract

Introduce a new public API `get_target()` in gRPC Python that returns the channel's target string. This API provides a stable way for clients and libraries to retrieve the underlying channel endpoint for observability, debugging, and routing.

## 2. Background

There is currently no public API to retrieve the target string of a gRPC Channel in Python. Users often resort to accessing private or internal attributes to obtain this information, which is brittle and not guaranteed to be stable across versions. To address this gap, we propose adding a public get_target() method to the grpc.Channel class.

This change is motivated by user demand and community-reported issues, such as [grpc/grpc#38519](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/38519), which highlight the need for a stable way to obtain the channel target string for observability and debugging purposes.

## 3. Goals

1. Provide a simple, public API to retrieve the channel's target string.
2. Ensure the method works regardless of interceptor layers.
3. Return `None` if the channel is shut down or in an unusable state.

## 4. Guide-level Explanation

Users can now write:

```python
import grpc

channel = grpc.insecure_channel("localhost:50051")
target = channel.get_target()
# target == "localhost:50051"

# After channel.close()
channel.close()
print(channel.get_target())  # None
```

* If the channel is active (IDLE, CONNECTING, or READY), `get_target()` returns the configured target string (e.g., `"localhost:50051"`).
* If the channel is shut down or in a non-connectable state (TRANSIENT\_FAILURE or SHUTDOWN), `get_target()` returns `None`.

## 5. Detailed Design

### 5.1 API Signature

```python
def get_target(self) -> Optional[str]:
    """Returns the verbatim channel target if the channel is active, otherwise None."""
```

### 5.2 Implementation

1. Use the existing `cygrpc.Channel.check_connectivity_state(try_to_connect=False)` to retrieve the current raw connectivity state of the channel.
2. Map the raw connectivity state (`cygrpc`) to the public `grpc.ChannelConnectivity` enum using `_common.CYGRPC_CONNECTIVITY_STATE_TO_CHANNEL_CONNECTIVITY`.
3. If the mapped connectivity state is not one of `{IDLE, CONNECTING, READY}`, return `None` to indicate that the channel is either closed or in an unhealthy state.
4. Otherwise, attempt to decode the channel target string using `self._channel.target().decode("utf-8")`.
5. If decoding fails due to a `UnicodeDecodeError`, re-raise the exception with an additional message describing that the error occurred while decoding the channel target string.

```python
class Channel(grpc.Channel)
    def get_target(self) -> Optional[str]:
        """Returns the Verbatim Target channel or None if channel is closed."""
        connectivity = _common.CYGRPC_CONNECTIVITY_STATE_TO_CHANNEL_CONNECTIVITY[
            self._channel.check_connectivity_state(try_to_connect=False)
        ]
        if connectivity not in (
            grpc.ChannelConnectivity.IDLE,
            grpc.ChannelConnectivity.CONNECTING,
            grpc.ChannelConnectivity.READY,
        ):
            return None
        try:
            return self._channel.target().decode("utf-8")
        except UnicodeDecodeError as e:
            raise UnicodeDecodeError(
                e.encoding,
                e.object,
                e.start,
                e.end,
                f"Error decoding channel target string: {e.reason}"
            ) from e

```
**Notes:**

* `self._channel` is the underlying `cygrpc.Channel` object.
* Returning `None` for any non-connectable state simplifies client logic, making it clear when the channel is unavailable.

## 6. Examples

```python
import grpc
# Create a standard insecure channel
channel = grpc.insecure_channel("localhost:50051")
print(channel.get_target())  # Expected: "localhost:50051"

# After shutting down the channel
channel.close()
print(channel.get_target())  # Expected: None
```

## 7. Alternatives Considered

1. **Separate Helper Library:** Provide a standalone function that introspects channel internals.

   * Drawback: Still depends on implementation details; users need to import a separate package.
2. **Environment Variable / Configuration:** Require users to manually track and pass the target.

   * Drawback: Error-prone, duplicative, and cumbersome to maintain.

By adding a public method on `grpc.Channel`, users get a first-class, stable API that works regardless of future refactoring.

## 8. Rationale

* **Simplicity:** A single method call (`get_target()`) is clearer than complex workarounds.
* **Stability:** As part of the public surface, this API will receive compatibility guarantees.

## 9. Implementation Plan

1. **Modify `channel.py` in gRPC Python core:** Add the `get_target()` definition.
2. **Update documentation:** Add a note about `get_target()` in the public API docs and README.
3. **Release:** Include in the next minor version (e.g., 1.74.0).

## 10. Backwards Compatibility

* Existing code that does not call `get_target()` remains unaffected.
* Introducing a new method does not break any existing public APIs.

## 11. Implementation
