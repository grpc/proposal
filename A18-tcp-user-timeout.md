## Abstract

Provide an option to set the socket option, TCP_USER_TIMEOUT on TCP sockets for
Linux kernels 2.6.37 and later.

## Background

TCP_USER_TIMEOUT is a socket option that has been available on Linux since
kernel version 2.6.37. As described the Linux manual page, "This option takes an
unsigned int as an argument. When the value is greater than 0, it specifies the
maximum amount of time in milliseconds that transmitted data may remain
unacknowledged before TCP will forcibly close the corresponding connection and
return ETIMEDOUT to the application.  If the option value is specified as 0, TCP
will to use the system default."

At the time this proposal was written, gRPC Core faced an issue where data could
be stuck for a very long time at the gRPC TCP layer. For cases where the network
goes down, and the socket cannot accept more data for writing, an RPC could be
blocked for a very long time. Even if the deadline expired on such an RPC, gRPC
Core was incapable of shutting down the RPC, because the TCP layer would still
have references to user data. Setting TCP_USER_TIMEOUT to a reasonable value
would put a bound on the maximum time the TCP layer would wait for TCP packets
to be acknowledged, and close the connection if the packets are not acknowledged
in time. This would end up releasing references to user data at the gRPC TCP
layer, thereby allowing the RPC to fail in a timely manner.

[Client-side Keepalive](A8-client-side-keepalive.md)
[Server-side Connection Management](A9-server-side-conn-mgt.md)

## Proposal

gRPC already has a mechanism to detect connection failures, called
[keepalive](A8-client-side-keepalive.md). The KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT configuration
option controls the amount of time gRPC waits for a HTTP/2 ping to be
acknowledged. Since the effective aim of KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT is similar to
TCP_USER_TIMEOUT, the proposal is to reuse this configuration option to set the
socket option TCP_USER_TIMEOUT. Since TCP_USER_TIMEOUT is only available on
Linux kernels 2.6.37 and later, this proposal is limited to those platforms.

Reusing the KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT configuration has a few repercussions.
* The keepalive timeout value will also take affect on all bytes sent via TCP
  and not just the HTTP/2 ping.
* A KEEPALIVE_TIME configuration of infinite disables keepalive and
  TCP_USER_TIMEOUT will also not be set. The system default will continue to be
  in effect.
* TCP_USER_TIMEOUT will have the same default value of 20 seconds as the
  keepalive timeout, if keepalive is enabled (KEEPALIVE_TIME is not infinite).

A very small TCP_USER_TIMEOUT value can affect TCP transmissions over paths with
a high latency or packet loss. If the timeout occurs before the acknowledgement
arrives, then the connection will be dropped. A very large value, on the other
hand will increase the time it takes gRPC to detect broken connections. Hence,
it will be the responsibility of the application to be prudent while setting
this option.

## Rationale

This proposal can help mitigate two separately seen issues, but with the same
root cause that was described above -
* [#15889](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/15889) - gRPC would potentially
  block indefinitely and not respect RPC deadlines.
* [#15871](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/15871) - Heavy loads prevent
  keepalives from destroying the connection.  Note that both issues occurred
  when a network was lost. The first issue mentioned in #15889 could also be
  solved by fixing the reference issue. This could be achieved by -
* making a copy of the user data - This would result in a significant user cost
* adding API to gRPC Core's TCP layer to be able to cancel writes for certain
  streams - This would require gRPC's TCP layer to understand streams and this
  breaks layers, not to mention the additional bookkeeping and overhead in doing
  so.

Even by doing one of the two currently known solutions, the issue mentioned in
#15871 would still remain, since we require sending the HTTP2 GOAWAY frame
before closing the connection in certain scenarios.

Other than solving the two described issues, TCP_USER_TIMEOUT would also provide
a fairly reliable way to detect TCP connection breakage without any additional
cost, or need to introduce another configurable option.

## Implementation

C-Core - [#16419](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/16419) sets the
TCP_USER_TIMEOUT socket option.

JAVA - For JAVA, the OkHttp library we use does not support setting such an
option. Netty with NIO also does not support this. Netty with epoll/kqueue
allows setting this option and the user is already capable of configuring this.

Go -

For non-Linux kernels and Linux kernels before 2.6.37, we do not yet have an
alternative that works for all.
