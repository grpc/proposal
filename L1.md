## Abstract

Provide C++ API's to coalesce:
- initial metadata and first streaming message
- final streaming message and trailing metadata
into the same core batch.

## Background

Currently when making a streaming call using gRPC and sending a single message,
three core batches are created: one for initial metadata, one for the message
itself, and one for trailing metadata.

Since the underlying transport has no knowledge that future messages are coming,
it's forced to assume it should initiate writes immediately for each of them.
In typical cases, this results in three sendmsg syscalls per stream.

The current API allows some coalescing via WriteOptions. One can do:
```c++
auto s = stub->Foo(...);
s->Write(first_message, WriteOptions().set_buffer_hint());
s->WritesDone();
```
This is difficult to discover, and further more it performs two round-trips
through the C Core stack, where it would be possible to do one.

## Proposal

### Expand WriteOptions to include an end-of-stream bit
```c++
class WriteOptions {
 public:
  // ... existing interface ...

  // last-message bit: indicates this is the last message in a stream
  // client-side:  makes Write the equivalent of performing Write, WritesDone in
  //               a single step
  // server-side:  hold the Write until the service handler returns (sync api)
  //               or until Finish is called (async api)
  WriteOptions& set_last_message();
  WriteOptions& clear_last_message();
  bool is_last_message() const;
};
```

### Add a convenience WriteLast method to ClientWriterInterface, ClientReaderWriterInterface, ServerWriterInterface, ServerReaderWriterInterface
```c++
// Perform Write, WritesDone in a single step
void WriteLast(const W& msg, WriteOptions options) {
  Write(msg, options.set_last_message());
}
```

### Add a convenience WriteLast method to ClientAsyncWriterInterface, ClientAsyncReaderWriterInterface, ServerAsyncWriterInterface, ServerAsyncReaderWriterInterface
```c++
// Perform Write, WritesDone in a single step
void WriteLast(const W& msg, WriteOptions options, void* tag) {
  Write(msg, options.set_last_message(), tag);
}
```

This will require finally exposing WriteOptions to async code also:
```c++
void Write(const W& msg, WriteOptions options, void* tag);
```

### Add a WriteAndFinish method to ServerAsyncWriterInterface, ServerAsyncReaderWriterInterface
```c++
// Perform Write, Finish in a single step
void WriteAndFinish(const W& msg, WriteOptions options, const Status& status void* tag);
```

### Expand client streaming stub signatures to add an overload that takes the first message
```c++
class Stub {
 public:
  // existing sync client-streaming signature
  unique_ptr<ClientWriterInterface<Request>> RequestStream(
      ClientContext* context,
      Response* response);
  // newly added overload
  unique_ptr<ClientWriterInterface<Request>> RequestStream(
      ClientContext* context,
      const Request& first_message, WriteOptions options,
      Response* response);

  // existing async client-streaming signature
  unique_ptr<ClientAsyncWriterInterface<Request>> AsyncRequestStream(
      ClientContext* context,
      Response* response, CompletionQueue* cq, void* tag);
  // newly added overload
  unique_ptr<ClientWriterInterface<Request>> AsyncRequestStream(
      ClientContext* context,
      const Request& first_message, WriteOptions options,
      Response* response, CompletionQueue* cq, void* tag);

  // existing sync bidi-streaming signature
  unique_ptr<ClientReaderWriterInterface<Request, Response>> BidiStream(
      ClientContext* context);
  // newly added overload
  unique_ptr<ClientReaderWriterInterface<Request, Response>> BidiStream(
      ClientContext* context,
      const Request& first_message, WriteOptions options);

  // existing async bidi-streaming signature
  unique_ptr<ClientReaderWriterInterface<Request, Response>> AsyncBidiStream(
      ClientContext* context,
      CompletionQueue* cq, void* tag);
  // newly added overload
  unique_ptr<ClientReaderWriterInterface<Request, Response>> AsyncBidiStream(
      ClientContext* context,
      const Request& first_message, WriteOptions options,
      CompletionQueue* cq, void* tag);
};
```

## Rationale

The last-message bit provides an avenue for our C++ wrapper to form a C core
batch that contains both a send message and a half close.

The WriteLast and WriteAndFinish methods, in and additional Stub stream
constructors provide first class discoverability to these API's. Importantly
code completion tools should offer them as suggestions to new developers, and
they'll appear in top-level documentation.

The Stub constructors allow a C++ implementation that forms a C core batch
containing both initial metadata and the first message.

By additionally offering WriteOptions on the new stub constructors we also allow
coalescing all of (initial metadata, one message, trailing metadata) for
applications that can benefit from it:
```c++
Status foo = stub->RequestStream(&ctx, only_message, WriteOptions().set_last(),
                                 &response);
```
The simple nature of WriteLast implementation offers an additional avenue for
developers to discover this option.

## Implementation

This should be straightforwardly implementable in the C++ layer.
