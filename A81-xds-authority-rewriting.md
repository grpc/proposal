## Abstract

gRPC will add support for xDS-based authority rewriting.

## Background

gRPC supports getting routing configuration from an xDS server, as
described in gRFCs [A27] and [A28].  The xDS configuration can configure
the client to rewrite the authority header on requests, although gRPC does
not yet support this feature.  This functionality can be useful in cases
where the server is using the authority header to make decisions about
how to process the request, such as when multiple hosts are handled via
a reverse proxy.  Note that this feature is solely about rewriting the
authority header on data plane RPCs; it does not affect the authority
used in the TLS handshake.

As mentioned in [gRFC A29][A29], there are use-cases for gRPC
that prohibit trusting the xDS server to control security-centric
configuration.  The authority rewriting feature falls under the same
umbrella as mTLS configuration.  As a result, if we add support for this
feature, we must do so in a way that allows disabling the feature for
these security-sensitive use-cases.

## Proposal

This proposal has several parts:
- Bootstrap config change: We will add a new server feature in the bootstrap
  config to indicate that we should allow authority rewriting.
- xDS resource validation: We will process authority rewriting fields in RDS
  resources and the hostname field in EDS resources, and return that
  information to the XdsClient watchers as part of the parsed resources.
- xDS ConfigSelector changes: We will change the xDS ConfigSelector to enable
  authority rewriting based on the chosen route.
- xds_cluster_impl LB policy changes: We will change the xds_cluster_impl LB
  policy to actually perform the authority rewriting if it was enabled by the
  ConfigSelector.

### Server Feature in Bootstrap Config

In order to address use-cases where authority rewriting may not be
acceptable from a security perspective, we will add a new server feature
to the bootstrap config.  The server feature will be specfied via the
`server_features` field described in [gRFC A30][A30].  The feature will
be the string `trusted_xds_server`.  (Note that the name is intentionally
fairly general, since it may be used to trigger other security-sensitive
functionality in the future.)

### xDS Resource Validation

When validating an RDS resource, if the `trusted_xds_server`
server option is present for this xDS server in the
bootstrap config, we will look at the [`RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite`
field](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/b65de1f56850326e1c6b74aa72cb1c9777441065/api/envoy/config/route/v3/route_components.proto#L1173)
field.  The boolean value of this field will be included in the parsed
resource struct that is passed to the XdsClient watcher.

When validating an EDS resource, we will look at the [`Endpoint.hostname`
field](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/b65de1f56850326e1c6b74aa72cb1c9777441065/api/envoy/config/endpoint/v3/endpoint_components.proto#L89).
The string value of this field will be included in a per-endpoint resolver
`hostname` attribute in the parsed resource struct that is passed to the
XdsClient watcher.  Note that the resolver attribute used here should
be a general-purpose one, not something specific to EDS; for example, in
the future, we may want to use this same attribute to expose per-endpoint
hostnames in channelz (see [gRFC A14][A14]).

For Logical DNS clusters (see [gRFC A37][A37]), the same `hostname`
resolver attribute will be added to all endpoints.  It will be set to
the name that is resolved for the Logical DNS cluster.

### xDS ConfigSelector Changes

When the xDS ConfigSelector performs routing, it will need to pass
the values of the route's `auto_host_rewrite` field to the LB picker.
This data will be passed using the same mechanism introduced in [A31] to
pass the cluster name to the xds_cluster_manager LB policy.  Note that
if the implementation is already passing along all of the information
about the selected route as per [A60], then no changes may be needed here.

### xds_cluster_impl LB Policy Changes

The xds_cluster_impl policy will store the value of the `hostname`
attribute in the subchannel wrapper when its child policy creates a
subchannel.  In the xds_cluster_impl picker, if the `auto_host_rewrite`
option is enabled in the route (passed from the ConfigSelector as
described above) and the `hostname` attribute on the subchannel wrapper
is non-empty, the picker will set the `:authority` header to the value of
the `hostname` attribute.

To support this, we will add an API to allow the LB picker to explicitly
set the `:authority` header for the RPC.  Note that this authority
rewriting will override the default authority for the subchannel, which
would otherwise be set from the resolver factory, a channel option,
or a per-address attribute returned by the resolver (i.e., the xDS
authority rewriting will take precedence over any of those settings).
However, if the implementation allows the application to explicitly
set the authority on a per-RPC basis (currently only C-core does this),
then that value would take precedence over the xDS authority rewriting.

Note that the resulting `:authority` header must be subject to a secure
naming check controlled by the ChannelCredentials, with appropriate
defaults.  In particular, TlsCredentials must by default perform a
per-RPC check that verifies that the RPC's `:authority` header matches
the name in the server's SSL cert.  (C-core already has this check,
but Java and Go will need to add it.)  Note that it is acceptable to
allow the application to explicitly inhibit this check, either by using
a ChannelCredentials implementation that doesn't support the check (e.g.,
InsecureCredentials or XdsCredentials) or by using an option to disable it
(e.g., TlsCredentials may expose an option to inhibit the check).

### Temporary environment variable protection

Use of the RDS `auto_host_rewrite` field will be guarded by the
`GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_XDS_AUTHORITY_REWRITE` env var.  The env var guard
will be removed once the feature passes interop tests.

## Rationale

We considered several alternatives to the server feature for enabling
use of authority rewriting:
- Using the existing XdsCredentials API (introduced in [gRFC A29][A29])
  to also enable authority rewriting.  This was deemed too complicated
  to implement in some languages, since we would have needed to provide
  a way to determine what channel credentials were used from the xDS
  routing code.  Also would have enabled the feature per channel instead
  of per control plane.
- Providing a channel option.  This would have required too much work on
  the part of applications to enable it on every individual channel.
  There were also some implementation challenges in some languages.  And
  it would not have provided a clean way to enforce disabling the
  setting in environments where that is required.  Also would have
  enabled the feature per channel instead of per control plane.
- Providing an environment variable.  This would also require
  applications to do work, although it would be in the deployment
  instead of in the application code.  And it would still not provide a
  clean way to enforce disabling the setting in environments where that
  is required.  Also would have enabled the feature per process instead
  of per control plane.

## Implementation

C-core implementation in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/37087.

Will also be implemented in Java, Go, and Node.
