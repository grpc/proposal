## Abstract

gRPC will support the [xDS Composite filter][composite], which is a
"wrapper" filter that dynamically determines which filter to use based
on request attributes.

[composite]: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/composite_filter

## Background

xDS support in the gRPC client and server are described in [A27] and
[A36], respectively.  xDS HTTP filter support is described in [A39].

The composite filter will make use of the Unified Matching API and CEL
support described in [A77].

## Proposal

We will support the composite filter in both the gRPC client and gRPC
server.

### xDS Resource Validation

Today, the composite filter supports configuring only one filter as a
result of the matching tree.  However, we have use-cases where we need
to select a chain of more than one filter based on the matching tree.
As a result, we are proposing a change to the composite filter's config
to allow selecting a chain of filters
(https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/40885).

The composite filter is configured via the
[`envoy.extensions.common.matching.v3.ExtensionWithMatcher`
proto](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/common/matching/v3/extension_matcher.proto#L25).
Within it, gRPC will look at the following fields:
- [extension_config](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/common/matching/v3/extension_matcher.proto#L34C39-L34C55):
  This must contain a
  [`envoy.extensions.filters.http.composite.v3.Composite`
  proto](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/filters/http/composite/v3/composite.proto#L33),
  which has no fields.
- [xds_matcher](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/common/matching/v3/extension_matcher.proto#L31):
  Specifies a unified matcher tree indicating the config of the filter
  to use.  The actions in this tree must be one of two types:
  - [`envoy.extensions.filters.common.matcher.action.v3.SkipFilter`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/filters/common/matcher/action/v3/skip_action.proto#L24):
    This indicates that no filter will be executed.
  - [`envoy.extensions.filters.http.composite.v3.ExecuteFilterAction`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/filters/http/composite/v3/composite.proto#L49):
    This indicates which filter should be executed.  Within it:
    - [typed_config](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/filters/http/composite/v3/composite.proto#L54C39-L54C51):
      The filter to configure.  It will be validated using the xDS HTTP filter
      registry, just as the top-level filters in the HTTP connection manager
      config are.  This field is ignored if `filter_chain` is set.  It
      is an error if neither `typed_config` nor `filter_chain` are set.
    - [dynamic_config](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/filters/http/composite/v3/composite.proto#L59):
      This field will be ignored for now, since gRPC does not currently
      support ECDS.  Support for ECDS will be added in a subsequent gRFC.
    - filter_chain (new field added in
      https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/40885): This specifies a
      chain of filters to call, in order.  Each filter in the chain will
      be validated using the xDS HTTP filter registry, just as the
      top-level filters in the HTTP connection manager config are.
      If set, the `typed_config` field is ignored.  It is an error if
      neither `typed_config` nor `filter_chain` are set.
    - [sample_percent](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/filters/http/composite/v3/composite.proto#L69C43-L69C57):
      - Optional; if unset, the specified filter(s) are always executed.
        If set, for each RPC, a random number will be generated between
        0 and 100, and if that number is less than the specified
        threshold, the specified filter(s) will be executed.
        Within this field:
        - [default_value](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/cdd19052348f7f6d85910605d957ba4fe0538aec/api/envoy/config/core/v3/base.proto#L648):
          This field must be present. The configured value will be capped at
          100%.
        - runtime_key: This field will be ignored, since gRPC does not
          have a runtime system.
- matcher: gRPC will not support this deprecated field.

We will also support per-route overrides via the
[`envoy.extensions.common.matching.v3.ExtensionWithMatcherPerRoute`
proto](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/common/matching/v3/extension_matcher.proto#L39C9-L39C37).
In this proto, the
[xds_matcher](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/0685d7bf568485eb112df2a9c73248cb8bfc1c37/api/envoy/extensions/common/matching/v3/extension_matcher.proto#L41)
must be validated the same way as the corresponding field in the
top-level config.  The value of this field will replace the value of the
field in the top-level config.

The parsed representation of the composite filter's config will be a
matcher tree, using the same unified matcher API implemented for [A77].
The actions in the matcher tree will be one of two possible values: a
parsed filter config, or an indication that the filter should be skipped
(in the case of a `SkipFilter` proto).

Note that in order to avoid potential stack overflows, we will impose
a maximum recursion depth of 8 when parsing HTTP filter configs.

### CEL Attributes

In addition to the CEL request attributes described in [A77], we will
also add support for some additional [CEL
attributes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/advanced/attributes.html#configuration-attributes)
that we expect to be useful for the composite filter.

On both the gRPC client and server sides, we will add support for the
`xds.route_metadata.filter_metadata` attribute.  To support this, we will
add support for parsing the [`Route.metadata`
field](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/f384ab2b3e3aa0564ef25f57dc2ed8ad61eaf0cb/api/envoy/config/route/v3/route_components.proto#L319)
in the xDS RouteConfiguration.  This field will be validated the same
way as cluster metadata, as described in [A83].  The parsed metadata map
will be added to the route in the parsed RouteConfiguration resource,
and that map will be accessed by this CEL attribute.  Note that we will
support only `filter_metadata`, not `typed_filter_metadata`, so that we
do not have to handle protobuf descriptor functionality; to that end, we
will use only those entries in the parsed metadata map that correspond
to `google.protobuf.Struct` type.

We will also add support for the following attributes on the gRPC server
side only (these attributes are not relevant on the client side):
- `source.ip`
- `source.port`
- `connection.requested_server_name`
- `connection.tls_version`
- `connection.sha256_peer_certificate_digest`

### Filter Behavior

Because all of the CEL attributes that we are exposing are available
when we see the client's initial metadata, that is the point at which
the filter will evaluate the matcher tree and decide which filter chain
to use.  After that point, all other filter hooks will be delegated to
the chosen filter chain.

If we ever in the future need to support other attributes that are not
yet available at this point, we will need to make changes here.

### Temporary environment variable protection

Support for the composite filter will be guarded by the
`GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_XDS_COMPOSITE_FILTER` environment variable. This
guard will be removed once the feature passes interop tests.

## Rationale

The composite filter API seems a little unusual.  One would naively
have expected it to be structured by having the matcher tree live
in the config for the composite filter directly, rather than using
`ExtensionWithMatcher`.  Unfortunately, that's not the way the API evolved
in Envoy, so we'll stick with what already exists for compatibility
reasons.

## Implementation

Will be implemented in C-core, Java, Go, and Node.
