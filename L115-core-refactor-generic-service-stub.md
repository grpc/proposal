## Abstract

We will refactor `async_generic_service.h` and `generic_stub.h` to move
callback based interfaces into separate targets. Existing files will include
the callback based interfaces.

## Background

This enables services to only depend on the callback based interfaces of the
generic stub and generic service.

### Related Proposals

None.

## Proposal

We will move `CallbackGenericService` in `async_generic_service.h` to a new file
`callback_generic_service.h` and make it a new public target
`:callback_generic_service`. `async_generic_service.h` will include
`callback_generic_service.h` and existing dependencies will continue to
include both.

We will also move move callback based interfaces of `TemplatedGenericStub` in
`generic_stub.h` to a new class `TemplatedGenericStubCallback` in
`generic_stub_callback.h` and make it a new public target
`:generic_stub_callback`. `CallbackGenericService` will inherit
`CallbackGenericService` and existing dependencies will continue to
include both.
