## Abstract

Move function declarations for insecure credentials from `grpc/grpc_security.h` to a new header file `grpc/grpc_insecure_credentials.h`.

## Background

According to the discussion in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/31012, it makes no sense to include `grpc/grpc_security.h` if the file has nothing to do with secure credentials.

### Related Proposals:

* Move function declarations for insecure credentials from `grpc/grpc_security.h` to `grpc/grpc.h`, which makes minimum effect.

## Proposal

Move function declarations for insecure credentials from `grpc/grpc_security.h` to a new header file `grpc/grpc_insecure_credentials.h`.

## Rationale

Moving function declarations to `grpc/grpc.h` seems to be convenient but not right. Moving them to a new file `grpc/grpc_insecure_credentials.h` makes more sense and is aligned with our goal to move every credential type to its own target.

## Implementation

Move function declarations for insecure credentials from `grpc/grpc_security.h` to a new header file `grpc/grpc_insecure_credentials.h`.
