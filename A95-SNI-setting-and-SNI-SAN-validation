### Background

In [A29][A29] for TLS security in xDS-managed connections, it
proposed that the `SNI` field from [UpstreamTlsContext.SNI][UTC_SNI]
would be ignored and [DownstreamTlsContext.require_sni][DTC_require-SNI] would 
cause the LDS update to fail. In proposal changes these, and also starts
using certain other related fields for securing TLS
connections via xDS.

For an overview of securing connections in the envoy proxy using SNI 
and SAN validation, read [envoy-SNI].

## Proposal
This proposal has two parts:
* Setting SNI
xDS-managed gRPC clients will set SNI for the Tls handshake for 
Tls connections using the fields from [UpstreamTlsContext][UTC]
in a CDS update.

1. If [UpstreamTlsContext][UTC] specifies the SNI to use, then
it will be used.

2. If [UpstreamTlsContext][UTC] specifies `auto_host_sni`, then
SNI will be set to the hostname, which is either the logical
DNS name for DNS clusters or the endponit hostname for EDS
clusters, as in the case of the hostname useed for authority
rewriting [Ar 81-hostname][A81-hostname].

[UTC]: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/ee2bab9e40e7d7649cc88c5e1098c74e0c79501d/api/envoy/extensions/transport_sockets/tls/v3/tls.proto#L29
[A81-hostname]: https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/4f833c5774e71e94534f72b94ee1b9763ec58516/A81-xds-authority-rewriting.md?plain=1#L85

* Server SAN validation against SNI used

If `auto_sni_san_validation` is set in the [UpstreamTlsContext][UTC] 
gRPC client will replace any Subject Alternative Name (SAN) 
validations with a validation for a DNS SAN matching the SNI value 
sent.
