## Abstract

This proposal describes a convenient API in each gRPC language to improve the usability of creating a gRPC server with admin services to expose states in the gRPC library.


## Background

There exists a class of RPC services whose purpose is to expose the overall state of all gRPC activity in a given binary. This set of services may grow over time, and some services may want to be exposed only conditionally, to avoid adding unnecessary dependencies (e.g., CSDS should be used only when xDS is used in gRPC).

The goal of this proposal is to provide a mechanism where applications can tell gRPC to add all relevant admin services to a given server, allowing gRPC to automatically determine which specific admin services are relevant. This way, individual applications don't need to change when the set of desired admin services changes.

## Proposal

Initially, the following admin services will be supported:

* [Channelz](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A14-channelz.md), which exposes internal state of channels, servers, and sockets;
* [Client Status Discovery Service](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/pull/223), which exposes the state of xDS resources requested by gRPC.

This proposal recommend the admin interface API design to be **a function that combines admin services from different packages**. Here are the usage snippets of admin interface API in four languages (Java/Golang/C++/Python):


### Java

#### Create An Admin Server With Existing gRPC Java API:

```java
server = ServerBuilder.forPort(50051)
        .useTransportSecurity(certChainFile, privateKeyFile)
        .addService(new ChannelzService())
        .addService(new CsdsService())
        .build()
        .start();
server.awaitTermination();
```


#### Create An Admin Server With gRPC Java Admin Interface API:

```java
server = ServerBuilder.forPort(50051)
        .useTransportSecurity(certChainFile, privateKeyFile)
        .addServices(AdminInterface.getStandardServices())
        .build()
        .start();
server.awaitTermination();
```


### Golang

#### Create An Admin Server With Existing gRPC Golang API:

```golang
lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":50051")
if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
}
defer lis.Close()
grpcServer := grpc.NewServer()
channelzService.RegisterChannelzServiceToServer(grpcServer)
csdsService.RegisterCsdsServiceToServer(grpcServer)
if err := grpcServer.Serve(lis); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %v", err)
}
```


#### Create An Admin Server With gRPC Golang Admin Interface API:

```golang
lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":50051")
if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
}
defer lis.Close()
grpcServer := grpc.NewServer(...opts)
adminServices.RegisterAdminServicesToServer(grpcServer)
if err := grpcServer.Serve(lis); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %v", err)
}

```


### C++

#### Create An Admin Server With Existing gRPC C++ API:

```cpp
grpc::ServerBuilder builder;
builder.RegisterService(grpc::ChannelzService());
builder.RegisterService(grpc::CsdsService());
builder.AddListeningPort(":50051", grpc::ServerCredentials(...));
std::unique_ptr<grpc::Server> server(builder.BuildAndStart());
```


#### Create An Admin Server With gRPC C++ Admin Interface API:

The admin services will use the gRPC C++ Sync API to offload the responsibility of managing polling and thread from users. In future, they might migrate to the gRPC C++ Callback API.

```cpp
grpc::ServerBuilder builder;
grpc::AddAdminServices(&builder);
builder.AddListeningPort(":50051", grpc::ServerCredentials(...));
std::unique_ptr<grpc::Server> server(builder.BuildAndStart());
```


### Dependency-based Admin Services List

In addition, by providing new APIs, we abstract away the individual services with the concept admin services. We can also achieve **dynamic admin services selection**, for example, we **only add CSDS service if the xDS package is pulled in as a dependency of the application**. In this way, the application can avoid adding unnecessary dependencies.


## Rationale

### Start Admin Server without Code Change

In other softwares, like Envoy, it’s common to see a pattern that specifying an environment variable will instruct the application to open a debugging/administration site. Or, for a more meticulous library, users can specify the admin configuration in their config files. However, those solutions don't apply to gRPC:

1. The default unsecured pattern has caused endpoint security concern in Envoy (see [envoy#2763])(https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/2763));
2. gRPC as a library should not open additional listening port without explicitly application code.


### Alternative Admin Interface API Designs

There are several different options for the convenient API design. Each option is a tradeoff between simplicity to use and flexibility. The simplicity to use is defined by lines of code to create a serving gRPC server with admin services, and the additional cognitive cost to learn the new API or manage dependencies. The flexibility is defined by how can users provide additional server creation options. To date, users can specify one or more **listening addresses, credentials, TCP/HTTP config, codec, interceptors and service implementations** during the server creation process. Not to mention the potential  impact on the threading model during the start of the server. If we want to bundle as many options as possible into one line of code, we will inevitably sacrifice some flexibility. For other alternative designs, see section below.

Here are the usage snippets for other API Designs in Java:

#### A method of the gRPC server class that adds admin services
```java
server = ServerBuilder.forPort(50051)
        .useTransportSecurity(certChainFile, privateKeyFile)
        .addAdminService()
        .build()
        .start();
server.awaitTermination();
```

This approach is more invasive than the selected solution. Expanding server class increases the complexity of surface API and yet didn't further reduce the minimum LOC needed to create an admin server.


#### A function that creates the gRPC server object bound with admin services;
```java
server = AdminServerBuilder.forPort(50051)
        .useTransportSecurity(certChainFile, privateKeyFile)
        .build()
        .start();
server.awaitTermination();
```

For this option, the `AdminServerBuilder` allows some flexibility, but it conflicts with `XdsServerBuilder` if users want to enable xDS, and it would be repetitive if we offers `AdminXdsServerBuilder` on the side.


#### A function that creates and starts the gRPC server with admin services.
```java
server = admin.StartAdminServer(50051, certChainFile, privateKeyFile)
server.awaitTermination();
```

For this option, advanced users might want to play with the admin service like adding interceptors or change credential types, but even tiny amount of change means fallback to use existing API.


## Future Work

### Console-to-Console Credentials

To date, if we want to securely guard an endpoint, the recommended way is using a TLS cert or via xDS’s mTLS (if rolled out). With proper setup, they work fine for long-lasting debugging ports. However, both of them are overly complicated for ad-hoc debugging, and may unfortunately nudge people to use insecure connections. From users’ perspective, they just want to inspect an gRPC application in one console with the tool in another console.

The problem has been solved by many other softwares, like Grafana uses username and password, iPython notebook prints a generated auth token to the console. The admin server serves sensitive traffic statistics that should be protected. With easy-to-use credentials, we are promoting protected connections, and it will prevent gRPC from following the Envoy’s admin interface design.


## Implementation

TBD
