## Abstract

Describes what types of TCP-level proxy setups gRPC will support and
how those setups interact with client-side per-call load balancing
policies (e.g., `grpclb` or `round_robin`).

## Background

It may be useful to read the following docs before this one:

- [gRPC load balancing](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/load-balancing.md)
- [gRPC name resolution](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md)
- [gRPC service config](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/service_config.md)

A TCP-level proxy is one that does not know anything about gRPC.
It accepts a TCP connection from a client, creates a new TCP connection
to another server, and forwards all bytes from the client to the server,
without actually understanding anything about the contents of those bytes.

Note that client-side per-call load-balancing within gRPC requires knowing
the addresses of the backends. Because of this, use of a TCP-level proxy
may limit the ability to do client-side per-call load balacing in some
environments.

### Related Proposals: 

- [gRFC A5: Encoding grpclb data in DNS](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/pull/10)

## Proposal

gRPC will support TCP-level proxies via the HTTP CONNECT request,
defined in [RFC-2817](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2817).

### Use Cases

We are aware of the following use-cases for TCP-level proxying with gRPC:

1. A corp environment where all outbound traffic must go through a proxy.
   This environment has the following properties:
   - Name resolution of external names does not work (i.e., all
     resolution must be done via the proxy).
   - Internal traffic does not need to use the proxy, but external traffic
     does.
   - In some environments, there will not be any gRPC traffic to any internal
     servers, in which case we can unconditionally send *all* connections
     through the proxy.  This configuration is generally triggered by
     some centralized signal, such as the `http_proxy` environment variable
     or Java system properties.

2. A partially protected environment, where access to certain addresses
   must go through a proxy.  This environment has the following
   properties:
   - Name resolution of protected servers works normally.
   - Only requests for certain hosts must go through the proxy.
     Requests to other servers work without the proxy.
   - Custom logic is used to determine which hosts the proxy will be
     used for.

3. An environment where a service is accessible from the Internet but
   its internal architecture should not be exposed publicly.  This
   environment has the following properties:
   - Name resolution of internal names does not work externally (i.e.,
     all internal resolution must be done via the proxy).
   - Only requests for services behind the proxy will go through it.

### Proposed Functionality

We propose the following functionality to support these use cases:

- We will have some internal state (e.g., a channel arg in C-core) that
  both triggers the use of the HTTP CONNECT handshaker and specifies the
  argument to be used in the CONNECT request.

- We will support a new type of hook called a *proxy mapper*, which
  offers two points at which proxies can be selected:
  - Right before the server name is resolved, the proxy mapper can be used
    to programmatically override the name that will be resolved.  It
    will also be able to set the internal state to trigger use of the
    HTTP CONNECT handshaker.
  - Right before we connect to the target address, the proxy mapper can
    be used to programmatically override the address that we will
    connect to.  It will also be able to set the internal state to trigger
    use of the HTTP CONNECT handshaker.

### Addressing Use Cases

That functionality will be used to address the three use-cases described
above, as follows.

#### Case 1

Case 1 will be addressed using the proxy mapper hook for overriding the
server name to resolve.  Sites that may want to send only external servers
through the proxy can implement their own proxy mapper to do this.
We will provide a default proxy mapper implementation that looks for the
existence of the `http_proxy` environment variable (or equavalent
signal).  If that signal is present, it will do the following:
- Ask the resolver to resolve the proxy name instead of the server name
  requested via the client API.  (Note that this will cause us to
  create a single subchannel to the proxy, as opposed to one
  subchannel for each backend server.)
- Add the state described above triggering the use of the HTTP CONNECT
  handshaker, with the argument set to the server name requested via
  the client API.

Note that in this case, because the client cannot know the set of server
addresses, it is impossible to use the normal gRPC client-side per-call
load balancing.  It *is* possible to do load balancing on a per-connection
basis, but that may not spread out the load evenly if different clients
impose a different amount of load.  (Note that even if we established
multiple connections to the proxy, we would have no guarantee that each
connection would go to a different backend server.)

Also, note that in this case, the client will not have access to the
service config for the server name.  This is not a problem in cases 2
and 3, where the service config data will be available as expected via
the resolver.

#### Case 2

This case will be addressed using the proxy mapper hook for overriding the
address to connect to.  When the proxy mapper sees an address that
should go through the proxy, it will do the following:
- Set the target address to the proxy address.
- Add the additional state described above to trigger the use of the
  HTTP CONNECT handshaker, with the argument set to the original
  subchannel address.  Note that in this case, the server name used in
  the HTTP CONNECT request will be an IP address and port, not a
  hostname (i.e., we are not relying on the proxy to do name
  resolution for us).

In contrast to case 1, in case 2, it *is* possible to do the normal
gRPC client-side per-call load balancing, because the client does know
the set of server addresses.  The fact that the connections to those
individual addresses go through a TCP-level proxy does not interfere
with the client opening a separate subchannel to each address.

#### Case 3

This case is similar to case 1 in that the resolver cannot return
the actual addresses of the servers.  However, we (ab)use the gRPC
load-balancing design to work around this, so that it looks more like
case 2.  In this case, there will be an external DNS SRV record for
the server name that points to the name of the proxy.  The resolver
will then return IP address of the proxy with the `is_balancer`
bit set.  (For details, see [gRFC A5: Encoding grpclb data in
DNS](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/pull/10).)  The proxy mapper
implementation will then have to detect two types of addresses:
- When it sees the proxy address, it will set the HTTP CONNECT argument to
  the original server name (which will cause the proxy to establish a
  connection to one of the load balancers).
- When it sees any internal address (i.e., the addresses returned by
  the load balancer), it will replace it with the proxy address and set
  the HTTP CONNECT argument to the internal address.

Note that this will work only if the `grpclb` load balancing policy is
in use; it will not work with client-side policies like `round_robin`.

## Rationale

The proposed design allows two different ways of triggering use of
the HTTP CONNECT handshaker code, which addresses the needs of the
use-cases described above.

There is one down-side to the approach for case 3, which is that the proxy
mapper and the name resolver both have to agree on the list of known
proxy addresses.  So, for example, if the proxy mapper implementation
is getting the list of proxy addresses from a local file, the service
owner would need to first push an updated list that contains the new
proxy address to all clients.  Then, once all clients have been updated,
the new proxy can be added to DNS.

Note that another alternative for case 3 would be to use a gRPC-level
proxy instead of a TCP-level proxy, where the proxy natively speaks gRPC.
The idea is that the proxy accepts a gRPC request from the external client
and then uses its own client on the internal side, which does the name
resolution and per-call load balancing internally to the backend servers.
The trade-off here is that this approach requires that the gRPC-level
proxy be trusted by all internal servers, which has security implications
(e.g., a successful attack on the proxy would yield priviledged access
on all internal servers).

## Implementation

In C-core, the HTTP CONNECT handshaker was already implemented.
The following additional changes have also been made:

- [grpc/grpc#9383](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/9383) (changes
  HTTP CONNECT handshaker to be triggered via channel args)
- [grpc/grpc#9372](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/9372) (adds proxy
  mapper hook for address rewriting)
- [grpc/grpc#9557](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/9557) (adds proxy
  mapper hook for name rewriting)
