## Abstract

This proposal proposes a requirement to only accept static strings (i.e.,
kept alive while gRPC is running) for `method` and `host` as the arguments to
`grpc_channel_register_call()`.

This change requires a major bump of gRPC version.

## Background

For pre-registering, `method` and `host` are pre-registered on channels using
`grpc_channel_register_call()`. Although no user that we are aware of uses
non-static strings for `method` and `host`, we have to conservatively intern the
strings since `grpc_channel_register_call()` is not clear about the ownership
and life-time of `method` and `host`. Interning `method` and `host` results in
unnecessary ref-counting and cache-line contention for every single call. This
can be eliminated by making them static.

## Proposal

Require static string for the `method` and `host` arguments to
`grpc_channel_register_call()`. That is the `method` and `host` strings must
be kept valid while the server is up.

## Rationale

`method` and `host` are reffed for every call. Doing an atomic fetch-add per
call is quite expensive, and truly unnecessary since the strings can easily be
kept alive while the server is up.

## Implementation

This is basically a simple comment update and removing `grpc_slice_intern()`
calls for `method` and `host`, as implemented in
[PR #19263](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/19263).
