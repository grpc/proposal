## Abstract

gRPC starts requiring C++14.

## Background

gRPC has been requiring C++11 from 2017 by
[Allow C++ in gRPC Core Library](L6-core-allow-cpp.md). As all compilers
that gRPC supports are now capable of C++14, gRPC is going to require
C++14 to benefit from new C++14 features.

This is aligned with
[the OSS Foundational C++ support policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support)
that says

*  We will support all modern C++ standards, from some oldest standard to the
   newest.

*  We will drop support for our oldest supported C++ standard when one of the
   following happens:
    *  All supported compilers default to a newer version
    *  When 10 years pass since the standard's release date

## Proposal

gRPC 1.46 will be the last release supporting C++11, future releases will
require C++ >= 14. We plan to backport critical (P0) bugs and security fixes
to this release for a year, that is, until 2023-06-01.

This change won't bump the major version of gRPC since this doesn't introduce
API changes. Hence, the next version requiring C++14 will be 1.47.
